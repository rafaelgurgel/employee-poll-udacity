## Dear reviewer

I have no idea what you are doing, but for certain there is something wrong.

I cloned the repo on a new machine, ran npm install then npm test then npm start and it all works

The code you say its not there is there, maybe you can delete the folder and clone again to be sure.

I am enclosing screenshots for your reference. The changes are there and were E2E tested, if you access github alone you will see that the package.json includes the required dependencies.

have a nice day
